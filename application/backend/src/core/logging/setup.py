"""Logging configuration and utilities for the application.

Provides centralized logging using loguru with:
- Worker-specific log files (training, inference, dispatching, stream loading)
- Job-specific temporary log files via context managers
- Automatic log rotation (10MB) and retention (10 days)
- JSON serialization and thread-safe async logging

    Creates separate log files for each worker type (training, inference, etc.) with

    Intercepts all uvicorn log messages (from uvicorn.error, uvicorn.access, etc.)

    logs follow the same format and routing as application logs.

    The function:
    1. Attaches InterceptHandler to the main uvicorn logger
    2. Sets propagate=False on uvicorn logger to prevent duplicate logs to root
    3. Clears handlers from child loggers (uvicorn.access, uvicorn.error)
    4. Enables propagation on child loggers so they forward to parent uvicorn logger

    Note: This should be called during application startup, typically before
    starting the uvicorn server.
