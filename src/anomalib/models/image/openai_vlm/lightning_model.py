        Anomalies may include mechanical malfunctions, unexpected objects, safety hazards, structural damages,
        or unusual patterns or defects in the objects.

        Instructions:

        1. Thoroughly inspect the image for any irregularities or deviations from normal operating conditions.

        2. Clearly state if an obvious anomaly is detected.
        - If an anomaly is detected, begin with 'YES,' followed by a detailed description of the anomaly.
        - If no anomaly is detected, simply state 'NO' and end the analysis.

        Example Output Structure:

        'YES:
        - Description: Conveyor belt misalignment causing potential blockages.
        This may result in production delays and equipment damage.
        Immediate realignment and inspection are recommended.'

        'NO'

        Considerations:

        - Ensure accuracy in identifying anomalies to prevent overlooking critical issues.
        - Provide clear and concise descriptions for any detected anomalies.
        - Focus on obvious anomalies that could impact final use of the object operation or safety.
