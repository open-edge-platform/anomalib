# Developer Guide

This section contains guides for developers and contributors to anomalib.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To set up your development environment, you need to install the dev requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies needed to format the code and run the tests.

## Code Style

To enforce the code style, we use several linters, type checkers, and formatters.
