# Pull Request Workflow
#
# This workflow orchestrates quality checks, tests, and security scans for
# pull requests using reusable workflows.
#
# Key Features:
# - PR title validation (conventional commits)
# - Code quality validation
# - Test suite execution
# - Security scanning
# - Concurrent execution handling
# - Automated feedback
#
# Process Stages:
# All stages run in parallel for faster feedback:
#
# 1. PR Title Validation:
#    - Conventional commit format verification
#    - Ensures proper changelog generation
#    - Can be fixed later while other checks run
#
# 2. Quality Checks:
#    - Code style verification
#    - Type checking
#    - Pre-commit hook validation
#
# 3. Testing:
#    - Unit test execution
#    - Integration testing
#    - Coverage reporting
#
# 4. Security:
#    - Changed files scanning
#    - Vulnerability detection
#    - Security report generation
#
# 5. Docker Image Build:
#    - Determines if docker images need to be built based on event type and changed paths
#    - Builds and uploads docker images as artifacts
#
# Required Secrets:
# - CODECOV_TOKEN: Coverage reporting token
#
# Example Usage:
# Automatically triggered on:
# 1. Pull requests to main branch
# 2. Pull requests to feature/* branches
# 3. Merge group events
#
# Note:
# - PR title validation only runs on actual pull requests
# - Individual commit messages are not validated (since PRs are squash merged)
# - Other checks run in parallel with PR title validation for faster feedback
# - PR title can be fixed later while tests are already running
# - Configured to cancel outdated runs when new commits are pushed
