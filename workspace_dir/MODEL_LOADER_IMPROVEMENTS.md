# Model Loader Improvements Summary

## What was improved:

### 1. **Simplified Class Design**
- Renamed `VisionTransformerEncoder` to `ModelLoader` (clearer purpose)
- Removed unnecessary constants and consolidated configuration
- Single responsibility: loading DINOv2 models

### 2. **Cleaner API**
- Simpler method names: `load()` instead of complex workflows
- Better error messages and validation
- Maintained backward compatibility with `load()` function

### 3. **Better Code Organization**
- Separated concerns into focused private methods:
  - `_parse_name()`: Parse model names
  - `_create_model()`: Create model instances  
  - `_load_weights()`: Handle weight loading
  - `_download_weights()`: Download from remote
- Removed unused imports and dependencies

### 4. **Improved Error Handling**
- Clear, descriptive error messages
- Proper validation of model names and architectures
- Graceful handling of download failures

### 5. **Modern Python Features**
- Used `pathlib.Path` consistently
- Type hints with `|` union syntax
- F-strings for better readability

### 6. **Simplified Configuration**
- Removed complex configuration classes
- Inline model configurations where appropriate
- Clear mapping of architectures to parameters

## Key Principles Applied:

1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Removed unnecessary complexity
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each method has one clear purpose  
3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Consolidated similar functionality
4. **Clear Naming**: Method and variable names explain their purpose
5. **Error Transparency**: Clear error messages for debugging
6. **Maintainability**: Easy to understand and modify

## Usage remains the same:
```python
from .model_loader import load

# Load a model
model = load("dinov2_vit_base_14")
```

The interface is now simpler, more reliable, and easier to maintain while following good software engineering practices.
