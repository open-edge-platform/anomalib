# Student-Teacher Feature Pyramid Matching for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection

This is the implementation of the [STFPM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04257.pdf) paper.

## TODO
* [ ] Add `test.py`
* [ ] Anomaly Heatmap computation is to be done via torch, not numpy.
* [ ] Custom model checkpoint to handle teacher-student model saving.
* [ ] Add sigopt support
* [ ] Add OpenVINO inference support
