# Contributing to Anomalib

We welcome your input! üëê

We want to make it as simple and straightforward as possible to contribute to this project, whether it is a:

- Bug Report
- Discussion
- Feature Request
- Creating a Pull Request (PR)
- Becoming a maintainer

## Bug Report

We use GitHub issues to track the bugs. Report a bug by using our Bug Report Template in [Issues](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/anomalib/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.yaml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+).

## Discussion

We enabled [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/anomalib/discussions/) in anomalib to welcome the community to ask questions and/or propose ideas/solutions. This will not only provide a medium to the community to discuss about anomalib but also help us de-clutter [Issues](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/anomalib/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md).

## Feature Request

We utilize GitHub issues to track the feature requests as well. If you are certain regarding the feature you are interested and have a solid proposal, you could then create the feature request by using our [Feature Request Template](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/anomalib/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md) in Issues. If it's still in an idea phase, you could then discuss that with the community in our [Discussion](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/anomalib/discussions/categories/ideas).

## Development & PRs

We actively welcome your pull requests:

### ¬†Getting Started

#### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

First, fork the Anomalib repository by following the GitHub documentation on [forking a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo). Then, clone your forked repository to your local machine and create a new branch from `main`.

#### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

Set up your development environment to start contributing. This involves installing the required dependencies and setting up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks. Note that this guide assumes you are using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) for package management. However, the steps are similar for other package managers.

<details>
<summary>Development Environment Setup Instructions</summary>

1. Create and activate a new Conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n anomalib_dev python=3.10
   conda activate anomalib_dev
   ```

2. Install the development requirements:

   ```bash
   # Option I: Via anomalib install
   anomalib install --option dev

   #Option II: Via pip install
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

   Optionally, for a full installation with all dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Option I: via anomalib install
   anomalib install --option full

   # Option II: via pip install
   pip install -e .[full]
   ```

3. Install and configure pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

Pre-commit hooks help ensure code quality and consistency. After each commit,
`pre-commit` will automatically run the configured checks for the changed file.
If you would like to manually run the checks for all files, use:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

To bypass pre-commit hooks temporarily (e.g., for a work-in-progress commit),
use:

```bash
git commit -m 'WIP commit' --no-verify
```

However, make sure to address any pre-commit issues before finalizing your pull request.

### Making Changes

1. **Write Code:** Follow the project's coding standards and write your code with clear intent. Ensure your code is well-documented and includes examples where appropriate. For code quality we use ruff, whose configuration is in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) file.

2. **Add Tests:** If your code includes new functionality, add corresponding tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/) to maintain coverage and reliability.

3. **Update Documentation:** If you've changed APIs or added new features, update the documentation accordingly. Ensure your docstrings are clear and follow [Google's docstring guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).

4. **Pass Tests and Quality Checks:** Ensure the test suite passes and that your code meets quality standards by running:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   pytest tests/
   ```

5. **Update the Changelog:** For significant changes, add a summary to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

6. **Check Licensing:** Ensure you own the code or have rights to use it, adhering to appropriate licensing.

7. **Follow Conventional Commits:** We use [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) to enforce conventional commit messages and branch names. This helps maintain a clean and consistent git history.

   <details>
   <summary>Commit Message Format</summary>

   Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**:

   ```text
   <type>(<scope>): <description>

   [optional body]

   [optional footer]
   ```

   **Types:**

   - `feat`: A new feature
   - `fix`: A bug fix
   - `docs`: Documentation changes
   - `style`: Code style changes
   - `refactor`: Code refactoring
   - `perf`: Performance improvements
   - `test`: Adding or modifying tests
   - `build`: Build system changes
   - `ci`: CI configuration changes
   - `chore`: General maintenance

   **Scopes:**

   - `data`: Data loading, processing, or augmentation
   - `model`: Model architecture or implementation
   - `metric`: Evaluation metrics

   <summary>Using Commitizen</summary>

   1. Stage your changes:

   ```bash
   git add <files>
   # or
   git add .  # to add all changes
   ```

   1. Create a commit using Commitizen:

   ```bash
   # Regular commit
   cz commit
   # or
   cz c

   # Signed commit (recommended)
   cz commit -- -s
   # or
   cz c -- -s
   ```

   Commitizen will guide you through an interactive process to create a conventional commit message.

   To check if your commits follow the conventional format:

   ```bash
   cz check
   ```

   To bump the version based on commit history:

   ```bash
   cz bump
   ```

<summary>Suppressing False Positives</summary>

If necessary, to suppress _false_ positives, add inline comment with specific syntax.
Please also add a comment explaining _why_ you decided to disable a rule or provide a risk-acceptance reason.

#### Bandit

Findings can be ignored inline with `# nosec BXXX` comments.

```python
import subprocess # nosec B404 # this is actually fine
```

[Details](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#exclusions) in Bandit docs.

#### Zizmor

Findings can be ignored inline with `# zizmor: ignore[rulename]` comments.

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@v3 # zizmor: ignore[artipacked] this is actually fine
```

[Details](https://woodruffw.github.io/zizmor/usage/#with-comments) in Zizmor docs.

#### Semgrep

Findings can be ignored inline with `# nosemgrep: rule-id` comments.

```python
    # nosemgrep: python.lang.security.audit.dangerous-system-call.dangerous-system-call # this is actually fine
    r = os.system(' '.join(command))
```
